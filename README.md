## **LAPD**: Service Call Intelligence Dashboard

*27 September to 6 October 2023*

Policing resources are scarce, and deploying assets without intelligence can put law enforcement officers and the public at risk. Awareness of trends in policing service needs – both where and when they are needed – is crucial for optimising safety, providing the public with policing services, and mitigating against officer burnout.

These interactive dashboards provide critical information across a wide matrix of spatial and time-related properties. Decisionmakers on resource allocation have at their fingertips LAPD service call information from 2019 at the city, area, and reporting district levels. Precise time classes can be used to fine-grain intelligence by considering the year, month, time of day, and season. Service calls are also grouped by certain classes (e.g., violence, child-related, etc.), and the top 10 most common service calls are highlighted.

See the Python code [here](https://github.com/DStrix66/lapd-dashboard/blob/main/lapd_eda.ipynb).

## **Salifort Motors**: Customer Churn

*2-13 September 2023*

## **Waze**: User Churn Project

*9 June to 1 September 2023**

Waze is a community driven navigation app that helps millions of users get to where they’re going through real-time road alerts and an up-to-the-moment map.
Typically, high user retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. This project develops a churn prediction model to help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. The questions answered in this project were Who are the users most likely to churn? Why do users churn? and, When do users churn?

This was a three-stage project, in which I was involved after the first stage. Read the project outline [here](), and see the code [here](https://github.com/DStrix66/waze-user-churn.git).

**Findings**

It was established that the data is insufficient for reliably predicting user churn and that further granular data is needed on app usage and geography. Given the data, it could be determined that users who are professional drivers and who use the app more in a month are the biggest predictors of whether a user will churn or be retained.

## **Workplace Absenteeism**

*24 April – 3 May 2023*

Employee absenteeism can have a significant impact on a company's productivity, operational efficiency, and overall performance. By conducting a comprehensive analysis and developing a predictive model, this project provides support to Human Resources decision-making. The project provides valuable insights into employee absenteeism patterns and delivers actionable recommendations for businesses to optimise workforce management, enhance productivity, and improve employee satisfaction.

**Key Findings and Recommendations**

* Scheduled medical appointments tend not to result in excessive workplace absenteeism, whereas having unplanned medical needs is a strong predictor
* HR is recommended to consider interventions to improve employee health and early medical need detection, e.g.:
    * scheduling regular medical check-ups at company cost
    * driving improved health culture in the workplace (e.g., a workplace gym, canteen that serves balanced meals)
* Employees staying further from work and with more children may be offered benefits like a tax-deductible company fuel card or a partial work-from-home accommodation
